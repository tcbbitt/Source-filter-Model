# Source-Filter Model Implementation in MATLAB

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Source-Filter Model, developed as part of my final paper on the "Implementation and Analysis of the Source-Filter Method for the Identification of Musical Instruments in Polyphonic Music." The code is based on the work of Heittola et al. [1].
