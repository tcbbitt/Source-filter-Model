# Source-Filter Model Implementation in MATLAB

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Source-Filter Model, developed as part of my final paper on the "Implementation and Analysis of the Source-Filter Method for the Identification of Musical Instruments in Polyphonic Music." The code is based on the work of Heittola et al. [1]. The original function "midi2hz,m" can be found in [2]. 

## Usage

To use the Source-Filter Model implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the Bach10 dataset at: [http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~zdu459/Bach10](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~zdu459/Bach10) [3].
3. Open the MATLAB environment and navigate to the repository directory.
4. Update the file paths in "main_3_4_1.m" to match the directories on your local machine.
5. run "main_3_4_1.m"

Feel free to customize the code according to your specific requirements.
